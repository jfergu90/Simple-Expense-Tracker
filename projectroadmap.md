Each person should have explored at least one existing Python code base related to
their project to evaluate using it in their project and submitted updates to the
projectroadmap.md file explaining their findings. In evaluating your codebase, you
should have read the code and attempted to run it yourself.

[Done] 1. Search for ideas

      -I wanted to find a project where I can keep a track of my expense. 
  
[Done] 2. Finalize the idea for the project

     -I searched for topics on expense tracker on github, youtube, and google and I have finalized to work on expense tracker project. 
  
     -There were a lot of ideas on github but it was far more advanced then the python knowledge I have. Luckily I found a project github that I can understand and work on. 

[Done] 3. Attach the resource URL found for the project

     -The page website is https://github.com/SouravJohar/expense-tracker
  
[Done] 4. Create a projectroadjmap and README on github

      -I have created a README and projectroadmap.md to keep in track of my idea and my project roadmap. 
  
[Work-in-progress] 5. Review the python code from the references

      -I have ran the code and saw some features. There is a feature where I can record my expense that asks me to include the category and the reason behind the expense. My   expense was not recorded so I have to find out why. 
  
      -found out the reason why I could not 
    
[ ] 6. Run the code and see how it works

[ ] 7. See if there are any changes to be made to improve on the code

      -made some changes to the wordings. For function View it asks the user to write down the category and the purpose behind the expense. Instead of writing down different categories I provided some category choices so users can take a look at the list before writing their category down. 
  
      -created a new fucntion Total where it asks user to write down their budget. I want to create a fucntion where it will tell you how much you have left and whether you are over the limit or not.
