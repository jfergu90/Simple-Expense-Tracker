# Simple-expense-tracker
Project Name: Simple Expense Tracker
# For this project I would like to create a program to keep track of my spending or amount of money. 


The reason why I wanted to create this project is because I have noticed the difficulty to keep in track of my expense and income. My income is not fixed and without properly keeping in track of my income on a daily basis, it will be difficult for me to find out whether my work is paying me the right amount of money. I have noticed I have been spending more than I need to and it is difficult for me to keep in track of how much I should spend and the total amount of expense I have spent for far.

With this project I can enter an expense, view previous expenses with date, update on my spending on the month. 

I have found a python project on github to demonstrate how I can work on my expense tracker. The website is https://github.com/SouravJohar/expense-tracker.
